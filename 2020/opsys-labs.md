# New Lab Assignments for Operating Systems and Systems Programming

## Supervisor: Hein Meling

## Prerequisites

- Must have passed DAT320 Operating systems and systems programming with excellent grade (B or better).
- Go programming language is required.

## Expected learning outcomes

- Become proficient in Go programming.

## Group composition: 2 or 3 students

## Project Description

In this project we want students themselves to develop interesting lab assignments for the OS course (DAT320). The project is open to some flexibility, but the assignments should focus on the topics covered in lectures and be related to the course book that we currently use. In particular, the students should examine all the exercises in the most relevant chapters, and also the Systems Labs in Appendix G. The project is expected to produce high-quality Go code, following established design principles (SOLID) and idiomatic Go and should follow the guidelines linked below. Furthermore, the project should describe the tasks (the `README.md` files), following the template of the existing labs, and the project is also expected to produce a solution, student skeleton and tests for students and Autograder tests. The assignments may also include multiple choice or other similar types of evaluations. Alternative evaluation types could also involve some integration with Autograder's frontend or a plugin for VSCode.

While the project report is mainly of a technical nature, some degree of pedagogy is expected.
