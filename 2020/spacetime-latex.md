# Design a Spacetime Package for Distributed Systems Protocols using LaTeX and Tikz

## Supervisor: Hein Meling

## Prerequisites

- Must be interested in graphics and typography.
- Be familiar with LaTeX.

## Expected Learning Outcomes

- Become proficient in LaTeX and Tikz programming.

## Group Composition: 2 Students

## Project Description

In this project to goal is to develop a robust and easy to use spacetime package for drawing space-time diagrams, such as distributed systems protocols. Such diagrams are used in scientific publications, and are preferred over message sequence charts (MSC) for space reasons. The supervisor has developed one such package in the past, but we want a more flexible and robust implementation. If anyone is interested in such a project, please contact the supervisor for more details.
