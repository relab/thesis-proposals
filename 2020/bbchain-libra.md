# Evaluate the Libra Technology Platform for use in BBChain

## Supervision: Hein Meling (w/ other BBChain team members)

## Prerequisites

- Distributed systems (DAT520)
- Rust and Go programming language
- Excellent programming skills

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to evaluate and possibly implement smart contracts for a document verification system using the Libra technology stack, and the Move smart contract language in particular. This project is offered as part of the BBChain research project, in which we have started to develop a similar set of smart contracts for the Ethereum blockchain.

The exact details of this project is currently unspecified, and can be discussed together with the supervisor and other BBChain team members. Note though, the project will require implementation and evaluation. It will not be a literature study.

## Background on BBChain

Today certified documents are mostly based on paper and the verification process is expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error and fraud [4]. Besides that, the current digital solutions that make use of digital signatures require third-party central authority and impose many limitations for use on a global scale. Some of these limitations are:

- Bureaucracy;
- Lack of interoperability and trust between issuers and verifiers;
- Centralization of information on third party companies;

Academic document verification procedure consists of the process, e.g., collecting, analyzing and verifying academic documents provided by a student, such as their diploma, transcript of records or any kind of academic degree certificate [5].

Institutions often require a copy of such documents as proof of qualification to attest the proficiency of the student. Thus, the authenticity of these documents need to be verified. Usually this is done by a certification authority (e.g., university administration department, notary office) through handwritten or digital signatures, stamps and watermarks.

The verification process checks that the document provided is legitimate and was issued by the correspondent institution for that student, and ensures that it was not tampered or forged.

Our BBChain project aims to build a global and public database of digitally authenticated documents, reducing the complexity and costs of the procedures for issuing and verifying academic degree certificates, while improving the trust and privacy between all involved parties.
