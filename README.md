# Instructions for writing a thesis proposal

- Please install the recommended extensions for VSCode, and fix typos and let the linter fix markdown issues. Easy pease.
- Please use one of the existing thesis proposals as a template for you own, and make sure to follow the structure to provide a consistent look and feel for the students.
- It is good practice to write a single sentence per line.
  If you are writing a bullet list, then you can start a new sentence by indenting the line with two spaces.
- You can use the markdown preview to make sure that the text is formatted correctly.
- Please use the markdown link format, where you list links at the bottom of the document, and refer to them using a number in square brackets, e.g., `[1]`.
  See for example the [2024/minimal-hash-func.md](2024/minimal-hash-func.md) file.
