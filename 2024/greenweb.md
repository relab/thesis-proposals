## Project Description

The goal of this project is to evaluate the resource and energy consumption of different web technologies.
The web is source for an increasing share of global energy consumption. In this thesis we aim to measure the footprint of different web technologies.

As basis for evaluation you should build a chat or game application, incorporating different web technologies, such as:
Long polling, Websockets and WebRTC.
This application should then be used to measure resource utilization, including energy used on the client side, bytes transfered and received, on the client and server side, ...

The topic may be extended by evaluating more advanced features, such as image or video transfer, or a calculation of Co2 equivalents used.

## Tasks

### Review and planning
- Review literature on resource utilization of web technologies, e.g. [1].
  - Write background section discussing the state of the art
- Propose a testing application
- Investigate and propose measurement tools

### Implementation
- Implement testing application with different technologies.

### Evaluation
- Evaluate resource usage and complete report.
