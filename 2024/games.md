## Project Description

Formal specification tools are used in software development to model and evaluate critical software design and algorithms.
For example TLA+ [1] and quint [2] allow to write highlevel specifications which can be executed. 
These tools also allow to verify properties on the state space of specifications.

In a recent effort [3], we have applied formal methods to verify game theoretic properties.

The goal for this thesis is to model well known examples from Game theory using TLA+ or quint, and verify their properties.
Some examples can be found on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_in_game_theory).

## Tasks
- Familiarize yourself with the TLA+ syntax, examples and tools.
- Propose a plan, which games and properties to model.
- Report and evaluate how games and properties can be modelled, and which sizes of models are feasible to execute.
