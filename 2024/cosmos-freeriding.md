# Reproduce and Defend Against Free Riding in Cosmos

## Administrative

- Supervisors: Leander Jehl and Arian Baloochestani

## Prerequisites

- Programming skills
- DAT650 Blockchain technology (Recommended)

## Project Description

Blockchains rely on users participation for their security and reliability due to their decentralized nature.
Therefore, many blockchains introduce economical incentives (e.g. giving out rewards) to motivate participation.
However, if these economical incentives are poorly designed, they can further introduce other challenges, one of such is free riding that happens when a process skips some part of the protocol and still gets as much as reward as other processes.
Free riding can be very dangerous in large scale since it lowers the participation.

The goal for this project is to analyze free riding in Cosmos [1], a well-known blockchain platform as a use case.
The project includes deploying Cosmos nodes, reproduce free riding, and implement some possible defenses.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Getting familiar with free riding and Cosmos
- Investigate how to deploy Cosmos nodes
- Reproducing free riding and analyze the effects
- Implement some possible defenses
- Analysis
