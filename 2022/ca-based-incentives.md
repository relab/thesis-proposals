# Simulating credit-based incentive mechanism using cellular automata

## Administrative 

- Supervisor: Hein Meling and Vahid Heidaripour Lakhani

## Prerequisites

- DAT520 Distribted Systems
- being familiar with cellular automata
- being familiar with wolfram language

## Project Description

There are three different incentive mechanisms in a peer-to-peer network in general: reputation-based, tit-for-tat, and credit-based incentives. The focus of this project is on credit-based incentives, which are more in use these days. For example, p2p storage networks like [Swarm network](https://swarm.ethereum.org/), pay their contributors for resource sharing. 

The main task of this project will be to implement a simulation tool using cellular automata that can capture the effect of changes in incentives, like changing the prices in the Swarm network.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Study the incentive scheme of the Swarm network
- Study cellular automata with wolfram mathematica
- Implement the simulation tool for Swarm storage network
