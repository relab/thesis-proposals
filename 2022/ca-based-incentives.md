## Project Description

There are three different incentive mechanisms in a peer-to-peer network in general: reputation-based, tit-for-tat, and credit-based incentives. The focus of this project is on credit-based incentives, which are more in use these days. For example, p2p storage networks like [Swarm network](https://swarm.ethereum.org/), pay their contributors for resource sharing. 

The main task of this project will be to implement a simulation tool using cellular automata that can capture the effect of changes in incentives, like changing the prices in the Swarm network.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Study the incentive scheme of the Swarm network
- Study cellular automata with Wolfram Mathematica
- Implement the simulation tool for Swarm storage network in Mathematica (or optionally C++)
