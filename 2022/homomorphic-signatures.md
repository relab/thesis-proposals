# Homomorphic Signatures

## Administrative

- Supervisor: Hein Meling and Rodrigo Saramago

## Prerequisites

- Strong math background
- Good understanding of cryptographic primitives
- Proficient in the Go programming language

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement the homomorphic signature scheme proposed by this [paper](#reading-material) 
in the go programing language. Being able to transform the specification into a library that could be used
in future projects.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Read and understand the signature scheme proposed in the [paper](#reading-material).
- Implement the proposed scheme in golang.
- Evaluate the performance of the implementation.
- Report on findings and lessons learned from the implementation, concluding on the feasibility of the developed signature
scheme for some real use cases (e.g. the academic use case mentioned in the paper).
