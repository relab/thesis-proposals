### Prerequisites

- Distributed systems (DAT520)
- Recommended to take DAT650 Blockchain technology concurrently

### Project Description

Committee-based blockchains are a popular varaient of blockchains in which a small group of processes are selected as the committee to decide over which block to append next to the chain.
In most committee-baased blockchains, first a leader is elected to propose a new block. 
Then, other committee members verify the proposed block and vote for it in case the block is valid. 
If the majority of the members vote for a proposed block, it is considered as approved. 

To incentivise the committee members we need a mechanism to reward them accordingly. 
Since only the committee members get rewarded, the committee selection algorithm needs to be fair, giving everyone a chance to get rewarded. 
The selection mechanism can be based on different things such as processes stakes (money they freeze before starting the protocol).

The main task of this project is to design a fair selection mechanism for committe-based blockchains based on their past behaviour. 
We would like to define some relevant properties and rank the processes fairly. 
The projects includes research (studying relevant papers and define the properties), and simulation (analyzing the proposed selection method with implementing it in python or go). 


### Tasks / Milestones

- Review literature about committee selection algorithms
- Analyse the existing algorithms
- Defining some fairness related properties
