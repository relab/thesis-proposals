## Project Description

Quint [1] is a novel specification language with support for execution and formal analysis.
The ability to execute specifications allows to create example runs which give a better understanding of how an algorithm functions. 
The connection to formal analysis allows to verify if the specification fulfills certain properties.

We have a formal specification of the Hotstuff algorithm [2,3]. 
Hotstuff is a consensus algorithm, which lies at the core of several Blockchain systems.
Quint is said to provide a more user friendly interface than traditional tools like TLA+.
The goal for this thesis is to transform the existing TLA+ specification for hotstuff to a quint specification. 

You should evaluate usability, and performance of the two tools.

No initial knowledge of the hotstuff algorithm or the tools is required. 
An interest in formal analysis, e.g. as done in subjects like discrete mathematics can be an advantage.

Depending on the progress in the thesis, you may work on additional goals like:
- Extending the quint specification to include additional details or
- Generating an additional quint specification of a different algorithm
