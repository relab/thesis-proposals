# Note for 2026

For 2026, we should add this to all our projects:

_As a condition of this thesis, you permit UiS to use the outcomes--including source code and other artifacts--for administrative, educational, and research purposes._
_This includes further development by UiS employees or students in future bachelor or master projects._
_Appropriate credit will be given in scientific contexts._
