## Administrative

- Supervisors: Leander Jehl, Arian Baloochestani

## Prerequisites

- Linux
- Recommended to take DAT650 Blockchain technology concurrently

## Project Description

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency based on the market capitalization and value after Bitcoin.
Few months ago, Ethereum shifted from Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to the Proof-of-Stake, which is more secure and energy efficent. 

Since it is very expensive to run experiments on the actual Ethereum blockchain, deploying ethereum nodes on a private network helps to run tests on a nearly real scneario. 
However, after the shift to Proof-of-Stake, the Ethereum official documents are not updated yet to guide on how to create such private Ethereum network. 

The goal for this project is to deploy Ethereum nodes on real servers (BBChain Cluster) using Proof-of-Stake as the consensus algorithm, and do some analysis.
These nodes include the full node which is in charge of voting and proposing blocks, and a client node which generates transactions. 

There are previous studies on how to deploy Ethereum nodes on a private network using Proof-of-Work, and can be used as a starting point. 


## Tasks / Milestones
