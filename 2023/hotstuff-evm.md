# Porting a smart contract engine to relab/hotstuff

## Administrative

- Supervisor: Leander Jehl

## Prerequisites

- DAT650 Blockchain technology

## Project Description

The Relab research group at UiS is maintaining a hotstuff based blockchain prototype [1].
However, currently the system only maintains a toy application, creating a blockchain.

The goal for this project is to port an existing smart contract framework to be used as an application layer on relab/hotstuff.
To reach this goal, you should evaluate at least three existing smart contract engines, or implementation of the evm for their feasiblity to be included in the project.
