# A simulator on Swarm storage incentive

## Administrative

- Supervisor: Leander Jehl and Vahid Heidaripour Lakhani

## Prerequisites

- DAT650 Blockchain Technology
- Excellent programming skills

## Background

Decentralized storage networks have developed over the past two decades with the idea of being an alternative to centralized data silos. 
This idea solves current problems like the **single point of failure** and possible **censorship** differently. There is no single node in the network that keeps all the data, and data is distributed all over the network. 
The Swarm storage network is one such system that tries to offer decentralized storage capacity to users. In Swarm, nodes share their storage capacity with others, store their data (in the form of small chunks with 4KB size), and receive a reward for it. The financial incentive is the primary motivation to encourage peers to participate in the network, and it is expected to prevent free-riding.

## Project Description

The scheme for storage incentives in the Swarm network is quite new and has many features for exploration. This project aims to build a simulation tool that will measure the fairness of the reward model by changing different parameters. Choosing the programming language and tools to do the simulation is up to you.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Understand the current storage incentive of the Swarm storage network using the reading materials
- Implement the simulation tool for the storage incentive
- Explain the observations with different parameters
