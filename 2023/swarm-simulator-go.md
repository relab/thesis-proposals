## Prerequisites

- (Go programming) (I don't know if there is a course for it.)

## Project Description

Incentives are the moving force behind decentralized p2p networks that encourage nodes to participate in such networks and share their resources with others. As we can see from the literature, networks without proper incentives suffer from problems such as free-riding and churn. Thanks to the blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, token-based incentives are now popular for these networks. Many parameters are involved in shaping a token-based incentive, and it is difficult to find the best combination that is fair while it can not be misused. To that end, building a simulation tool to try different parameters makes sense.

For this project, specifically, we want to simulate the bandwidth incentive layer of Swarm storage network, a decentralized p2p storage network.

The goal for this project is to build a simulation tool that works with different incentive parameters as well as different network parameters, and analyze their impact on reward system.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Understand the Kademlia overlay network
- Simulate the p2p network based on Kademlia
- Add bandwidth incentive layer
