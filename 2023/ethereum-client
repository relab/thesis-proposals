# Deploying Ethereum Nodes on BBChain Cluster

## Administrative

- Supervisor: Arian Baloochestani

## Prerequisites

- Linux

## Project Description

Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency based on the market capitalization and value after Bitcoin.
Few months ago, Ethereum shifted from Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm to the Proof-of-Stake, which is more secure and energy efficent. 

The goal for this project is to deploy Ethereum nodes on real servers (BBChain Cluster), and do some analysis.
These nodes include the full node which is in charge of voting and proposing blocks, and a client node which generates transactions.
