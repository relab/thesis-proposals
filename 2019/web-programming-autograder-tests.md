# Autograder Tests for Web-programming Exercises

### Supervisor: Leander Jehl

### Prerequisits:

- Web Programming (DAT310)

### Project Description

Autograder is a system build at UiS to automatically evaluate student hand-ins.
Autograder is able to run a set of tests against any hand-in delivered by
students and will provide a score and feedback for the students.

The goal of this project is to develop such tests for the exercises currently
used in the web-programming course.
This may also require a making changes to some of the exercises, to improve the ability
to test. One challenge is how to test visual aspects, i.e. frontend design. To that end,
one should examine if Selenium or other existing web testing tools can be integrated
into the Autograder system.
