# Web Assembly for system programming

### Supervisor: Leander Jehl

### Prerequisits
- Operating systems (DAT320)
- Programming skills in Go, Rust, or C++ or insterest to learn

### Project

The goal of this project is to evaluate the use of Web Assembly as compile target and runtime for distributed or networked systems.
Towards this goal, you should implement a simple distributed application in at least two languages that support compilation to Web Assembly, e.g. Go, Rust, C++.
All versions should use the same data format, preferably Protobuf, and may build upon GRPC libraries.

Resulting implementations should be compiled to Web Assembly and run using interpreters or virtual machines.

The goal is to evaluate both performance, and usability or ease of programming.
