# Implementing PBFT using Reactive programming and asynchronous workflows

## Administrative

- Supervisor: Leander Jehl and Thomas Stidsborg Sylvest

## Prerequisites

- DAT520 Distributed Systems
- Excellent knowledge of C# and programming skills

## Project Description

The goal for this project is to investigate the use of reactive programming and asynchronous workflows for implementing the PBFT algorithm.
To achieve this you should implement the PBFT using the Cleipnir framework.

Cleipnir is a .NET framework specifically designed for the implementation of distributed algorithms, using reactive programming, asynchronous I/O, and persistent programming.

## Tasks / Milestones

- Understand the PBFT algorithm
- Understand the use of reactive programming in the Cleipnir framework
- Design how to use reactive programming in the implementation of PBFT
- Implement the system iteratively
