## Background on BBChain

Today certified documents are mostly based on paper and the verification process is expensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error and fraud (see [World Economic Forum](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Known_Traveller_Digital_Identity_Concept.pdf)).
Besides that, the current digital solutions that make use of digital signatures require third-party central authority and impose many limitations for use on a global scale.
Some of these limitations are:

- Bureaucracy;
- Lack of interoperability and trust between issuers and verifiers;
- Centralization of information on third party companies;

Academic document verification procedure consists of the process, e.g., collecting, analyzing and verifying academic documents provided by a student, such as their diploma, transcript of records or any kind of academic degree certificate (see [Verifiable Claims for Educational Systems](https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/#education)).

Institutions often require a copy of such documents as proof of qualification to attest the proficiency of the student.
Thus, the authenticity of these documents need to be verified. Usually this is done by a certification authority (e.g., university administration department, notary office) through handwritten or digital signatures, stamps and watermarks.

The verification process checks that the document provided is legitimate and was issued by the correspondent institution for that student, and ensures that it was not tampered with or forged.

Our BBChain project aims to build a global and public database of digitally authenticated documents, reducing the complexity and costs of the procedures for issuing and verifying academic degree certificates, while improving the trust and privacy between all involved parties.
